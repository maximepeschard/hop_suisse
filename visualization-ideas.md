# Some ideas for the visualization part

## Style

To do : define color palette(s) or use existing one(s) matching Switzerland and
EPFL visual identities. See :

* http://atelierweb.epfl.ch/charte-graphique/infographies
* http://www.monokini.ch/portfolio-item/bibliotheque-epfl/

## Global

For the overall data available :
* information about participants (basic plots, maybe we can try to make them
  look nice / have a style related to sport / Switzerland ):
  * sex
  * age
  * origin
* information about the races in general : 
  * type / length (10km / 21km / marathon / etc)
  * places (nice map(s) here)

## Participants

* Number of races / participant (/year)

* If we have longitudinal data, at least for some people, we can maybe display
  their "evolution" (relevant measure(s) using time / speed / ranking) (in
  general or for a particular race if they have done it several times).

## Races

Detailed information by race :
* overall performance (time stats)
* number of participants
* weather

## Machine learning

Whatever result we will found :-)
