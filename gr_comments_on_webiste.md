- when type a runner's name you get a nice plot...that is _not_ the 'speed' but the 'time' distribution

- why some runners are completely missing ? (@deationor maybe ? ) - I just looked for some phd friends of mine in SV, that run with me - 
[giorgio tamo](http://www.alphafoto.com/images.php?runID=810&sn=14288), 
[alessio prunotto](http://www.alphafoto.com/images.php?runID=810&sn=14139), etc...
and [this guy that was runnning with 'one leg'](http://www.alphafoto.com/images.php?runID=744&sn=2169)

- it's weird that there are _no_ results at all for some runners, like for instance 
[this runner](https://hopsuisse.github.io/runners/?runner=Lazzarini+Reto+1973)


- I don't think performance it's a 'performance factor' - maybe you can also remove it 

## https://hopsuisse.github.io/races/

 very nice :)

 - for the 'Times distribution' maybe you can split in m/f ?

 - 'run exploratory and statistical analysis on this data' (??): _exploratory_ is a type of stat. ana. ... (right?)

 - '...for the sake of simplicity and ease of use.': maybe you should rephrase this sentence...

## https://hopsuisse.github.io/lausanne/ - nice overall ;)


 - 'focuses on a statistical analysis' -->   ' focuses on _the_ statistical analysis'
 - 'to this jupyter notebook hosted on Github.' --> this is the _wrong_ link: out the open repo instead
 - yeah, [this pie-chart](https://hopsuisse.github.io/lausanne/#number-of-runners-by-sex-and-by-category)
 doesn't make a lot of sense...better to just merge the first 3 sections in _just 1_ histogram

- can you please remember me to improve 
[this plot](https://hopsuisse.github.io/lausanne/#towns-of-residence-of-the-runners) - or you could also do it by applying the _powerlaw_ modele, as I did for the full dataset = I will do asap

- are you sure you actually plotted women/men in 
[these plots](https://hopsuisse.github.io/lausanne/#paces-distribution-by-category) ?  ...becasue the 2 plots look _too similar_ ... :P 

## https://hopsuisse.github.io/fullanalysis/

- same here:  'refer to this Jupyter notebook hosted' - that's _not the open repo_ 

- I would improve the english of the 
[note on runner's uniqueness](https://hopsuisse.github.io/fullanalysis/#note-on-unique-runners)

- axis labels missing in [this plot](https://hopsuisse.github.io/fullanalysis/#distribution-of-the-number-of-editions-per-race) - '# races  VS # editions/race'

- why not adding the threshold for the p-value in
[this section](https://hopsuisse.github.io/fullanalysis/#age-across-editions) ? ;)  - p<0.05


- could you try to plot better the _median_ in the 
[age VS time plot](https://hopsuisse.github.io/fullanalysis/#statistics-on-performance-vs-age) ?  - just to see if we get better 'u-dependece' :)
