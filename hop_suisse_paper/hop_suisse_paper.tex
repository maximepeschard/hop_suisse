	\subsection*{Demographics}
	
		In fig. \ref{participation_overall_by_distance} and \ref{participation_overall_by_gender} we show respectively how the number of runners increased in the last 15 years, by distances and gender. 
		This raise was steeper for man than for women (fig. \ref{participation_overall_by_gender}), and steeper in the shorter distance (10 Km) than in the longer ones ( fig. \ref{participation_overall_by_distance} - participants in full marathons seems to have decreased though) \footnote{For simplicity we only include the most popular distances. 
		There are many events that include shorter distances, like 3 Km, 5 Km, usually attended by a small fraction of young runners.}.

		For a significant analysis of runners' performance, it is important to check the amount of data present in the various events, and therefore first assess the heterogeneity of  events popularity.
		In fig. \ref{dist_number_editions_race} we show the  distribution of number of editions each event was hosted, across all history. Counting all editions of  all races as independent, we recorded 222 events. 
		More interestingly in fig. \ref{number_runners_per_race} one can see the broad distribution of number of participants in the different events. In particular, a power-law fit  ( $ f(x) \sim x^{-\alpha} $) provides an exponent of $ \alpha = 1.69 \pm 0.05 $\footnote{The power-law starts from  a lower-bound, whose value results as well from the fitting procedure: $ x_{min} = 688  $ runners/race}.

			\caption{Assess popularity of running competitions, in Switzerland.}
		
		
		\end{figure}		
	
		Inversely, one can measure how participative runners have been across Switzerland. 
		In fig. \ref{number_races_per_runner} we show the distribution\footnote{		One can see that a log-normal would fit better in this case than a power-law model. In particular the fitted parameters are $ \mu = -0.70, \sigma  = 1.55 $} of  the number of events to which each runners participated. We collected data from  a total number of 531426 runners.

	\subsection*{Overall performance analysis}
	
		\subsubsection*{Age-performance relation}
		
		
			We wanted to check whether the previously found	\cite{connick2015relative,knechtle2014relationship,lara2014relationship,lehto2016effects}
			U-relation between age and performance holds as well in the case of swiss races. 
			In fig. \ref{performance_VS_age_marathon} 
			(\textbf{plot to be improved!}) 
			we show the dependence of runners' performance on age, for four of the most popular swiss marathons. 
			The above-mentioned U-shaped although still slightly appearing in the longest distance (42Km), it does emerge more clearly in the half-marathons, as  shown indeed in fig. \ref{performance_VS_age_semi_marathon}
			(\textbf{plot to be improved!})

\section*{Discussion}

%The Discussion should be succinct and must not contain subheadings.

\section*{Methods}

%Topical subheadings are allowed. Authors must ensure that their Methods section includes adequate experimental and characterization data necessary for others in the field to reproduce their work.

	\subsection*{Data parsing}
	
		@stefano 
		(remember to add the \textit{definition of runner})
	
		
	
	
	\subsection*{Data analysis}
	
		All analysis were performed on python notebooks (available on the \href{related repository}{related repository}), using standard python packages for data analysis and plotting, such as \texttt{pandas}, \texttt{seaborn}, \texttt{scipy}, \texttt{powerlaw}\footnote{\url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/powerlaw}} and \texttt{networkx}.
	
	
	\subsection*{Data visualization}		
	
		We implemented interactive visualizations of some of our results and collected  them in the   \href{https://hopsuisse.github.io}{Hop Suisse}\footnote{\url{https://hopsuisse.github.io}} website.
		After exporting the data needed for the plot in \texttt{.json} dumps, we used \href{http://c3js.org}{C3.js} for the interactive plotting. More details on how datasets queries and plots were built can be found on the dedicated \href{https://github.com/hopsuisse/hopsuisse.github.io}{GitHub repository}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/hopsuisse/hopsuisse.github.io}}.
		We also build an \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvbnOXHShw}{animated infographics}\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvbnOXHShw}}, inspired by  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling}{Hans Rosling}'s work. With such video we wanted to show in a more powerful and clear way the relations among runners' mean pace, experience and age, providing as well information on gender and race length
		(the python code used to construct the video frames can be found in the \href{https://github.com/ggrrll/hop_suisse_ada_project_public/tree/master/8-video}{related folder}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ggrrll/hop_suisse_ada_project_public/tree/master/8-video}} of our GitHub repository).
